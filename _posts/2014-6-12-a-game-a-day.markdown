I'm going to make a game a day for 18 days - one for each of the iOS game categories.

##Details

I'll be using a cross platform engine I've been working on to make each game. One of the reasons I'm doing this is to improve my engine and get better at making games.

I will be releasing these games for free on mobile (Android, iOS, and Windows Phone).

I'm starting tomorrow.
